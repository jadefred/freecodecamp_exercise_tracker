# About

It is a project for the freeCodeCamp Backend certification - [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/).

This project requires us to build a full-stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://exercise-tracker.freecodecamp.rocks)

# Technologies

<ul>
<li><strong>Node.js</strong> & <strong>Express</strong> to create a web server and handle requests and responses.</li>
<li><strong>Mongoose</strong> to store and retrieve data as well as using its function to query and sort users' requests</li>
</ul>

# How to use

Run the following on the terminal :

```
npm install
npm run start
```

You could also use nodemon to automatically refresh the web server.

Don't forget to connect to MongoDB by adding your key directly in `server.js` or by creating a `.env` file to protect your key.
